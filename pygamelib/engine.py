The game module contains the core classes for a game:

 * The Game object itself.
 * The Board object.
 * The Inventory object.

The Game object is what could be called the game engine.
It holds a lot of methods that helps taking care of some complex mechanics behind the
curtain.

The Board class is the base class for all levels.

class Board(base.PglBaseObject):
    """A class that represent a game board.

    The board object is a 2D matrix of board items. This means that you can visualize it
    as a chessboard for example. All board items are positioned on this chessboard-like
    object and can be moved around.

    The Board object is the base object to build a level. Once created to your liking
    you can add items from the :ref:`boarditem-module` module. You can also derived
    :class:`~pygamelib.board_items.BoardItem` to create your own board items, specific
    to your game.

    If you want a detailed introduction to the Board object, go the the pygamelib wiki
    and read the "`Getting started: the Board
    <https://github.com/pygamelib/pygamelib/wiki/Getting-started-Board>`_" article.

    .. Note:: In version 1.3.0 a new screen rendering stack was introduced. With this
       came the need for some object to hold more information about their state. This is
       the case for Board. To use partial display with the :class:`Screen` buffer system
       the board itself needs to hold the information about were to draw and on what to
       focus on. The existing code will still work as the :class:`Game` object takes
       care of forwarding the information to the Board. However, it is now possible to
       exploit the :class:`~pygamelib.board_items.Camera` object to create cut scenes
       and more interesting movements.

    .. Important:: Partial display related parameters are information used by the
       :func:`~pygamelib.engine.Board.display_around()` method and the :class:`Screen`
       object to either display directly the board (display_around) or render the Board
       in the frame buffer. **You have to make sure that the focus element's position
       is updated**. If you use the player, you have nothing to do but the Camera object
       needs to be manually updated for example.

    .. Warning:: in 1.3.0 the notion of layers was added to the Board object. Layers are
       used to better manage items overlapping. For the moment, layers are automatically
       managed to expand and shrink on demand (or on a need basis). You can use the
       layer system to add some depth to your game but you should be warned that you may
       experience some issues. If it is the case please report them on the
       `Github issues page <https://github.com/pygamelib/pygamelib/issues>`_.
       For existing code, the entire Board object behaves exactly like in version 1.2.x.

            integers).
         2 - route toward the right moving function depending if the item is complex or
            not.

        Move an item in the specified direction for a number of steps.

        :param item: an item to move (it has to be a subclass of Movable)
        :type item: pygamelib.board_items.Movable
        :param direction: a direction from :ref:`constants-module`

        If the item is not a subclass of Movable, an PglObjectIsNotMovableException
        exception (see :class:`pygamelib.base.PglObjectIsNotMovableException`).

        Example::

            (see :class:`pygamelib.boards_item.BoardItemVoid`) will be put at the

            item). If the movable item is over an overlappable item, the

         4. It sets the cursor position to 0,0 (meaning that your user_update function

         8. Actuates projectiles (If there is at least one Board manage by Game).
         9. Animates items (If there is at least one Board manage by Game).

        On the subject of particle emitters, the :class:`Board` object automatically
        update the ones that are attached to BoardItems. For all other particle emitters
        you need to call the update method of the emitters yourself (for now).

        In version 1.2.X, there was a bug when the game was paused. In that case nothing
        was happening anymore. The user update function was not called and events were
        not processed. On top of that it was impossible to use run() without associating
        a board object with a level.
        Starting with version 1.3.0, it is now possible to use run() without associating
        a board object with a level. There is also a new parameter to the
        constructor (user_update_paused) that allows you to specify a function that will
        be called when the game is paused. This function will be called with the same
        3 parameters than the regular update function: the game object, the user input
        (can be None) and the elapsed time since last frame.

        .. Important:: If you try to set the game state to PAUSED and the
           user_update_paused function is not defined, a notification will be issued
           and the game will continue to run. The notification message is
           :boldblue:`pygamelib.engine.Game.run:PauseNotAvailable`

    This class is pretty straightforward: it is an object container, you can add, get
    and remove items and you can get a value from the objects in the inventory.

    On top of that, starting with version 1.3.0, a constraints system has been added.
    It allows to specify a certain amount of constraints that will be applied to the
    items when they are added to the inventory.

    For the moment, constraints are limited to the number of items with a given type/
    name/value (any combination of these three).

    When a constraint is violated, the item is not added to the inventory and a
    notification is broadcasted to the observers of the inventory. A
    PglInventoryException is also raised with name "constraint_violation" and the
    constraint details in description.

    .. note:: You can print() the inventory. This is mostly useful for debug as you want
        to have a better display in your game.

    The screen object is pretty straightforward: it is an object that allow manipulation
    of the screen.

    .. role:: boldgreen

    .. WARNING:: Starting with version 1.3.0 the terminal parameter has been removed.
       The Screen object now takes advantage of base.Console.instance() to get a
       reference to a blessed.Terminal object.

    Version 1.3.0 introduced a new way of managing the screen. It rely on an internally
    managed display buffer that allows for easier positioning and more regular
    rendering. This comes at a cost though as the performances takes a hit. The screen
    should still be able to be refreshed between 50 and 60+ times per seconds (and still
    around 30 times per second within a virtual machine). These numbers obviously
    depends on the terminal used, the screen size and the content to display.

    This change introduce two ways of displaying things on the screen:

       * The **Improved Screen Management** stack (referred to as :boldgreen:`ISM` later
         in the doc).
       * The **Legacy Direct Display** stack.

    It is safer to consider them mutually incompatible. In reality the **Improved Screen
    Management** will always use the whole display but you can use the methods from the
    **Direct Display** stack to write over the buffer. It is really **NOT** advised.

    We introduced the **Improved Screen Management** stack because the direct display is
    messy and does not allow us to do what we want in term of positioning, UI, etc.

    A typical usage consist of:

       * Placing elements on the screen with :func:`place()`
       * Update the screen with :func:`update()`

    That's it! The screen maintain its own state and knows when to re-render the display
    buffer. You don't need to manually call :func:`render()`. This helps with
    performances as the frame buffer is only rendered when needed.

    Example::

        screen = Screen()
        # The next 3 lines do the same thing: display a message centered on the screen.
        # Screen Buffer style
        screen.place('This is centered', screen.vcenter, screen.hcenter)
        screen.update()
        # Direct Display style
        screen.display_at('This is centered', screen.vcenter, screen.hcenter)
        # The rest of this example uses the Screen Buffer (because placing a Board
        # anywhere on the Screen is not supported by the Direct Display stack).
        # delete the previous message and place a Board at the center of the screen
        screen.delete(screen.vcenter, screen.hcenter)
        screen.place(
            my_awesome_board,
            screen.vcenter - int(my_awesome_board.height/2),
            screen.hcenter - int(my_awesome_board.width/2)
        )
        screen.update()

    **Precisions about the Improved Screen Management stack:**

    You don't need to know how the frame buffer works to use it. However, if you are
    interested in more details, here they are.

    The Improved Screen Management stacks uses a double numpy buffer to represent the
    screen. One buffer is used to place elements as objects (that's the buffer managed
    by :func:`place()` or :func:`delete()`). It is never directly printed to the screen.
    It is here to simplify screen maintenance. This buffer is called the **display
    buffer**. It is practical to use to place, move and delete elements on the screen
    space. But as said before it cannot be directly printed to the screen. It needs to
    be rendered first.

    For example, if you want to use a sprite on a title screen and want to move it
    around (or animate the screen). Normally (i.e with Direct Display) you would display
    the sprite at a specific position and then would either call :func:`clear()` or
    overwrite all the sprite with spaces to erase and replace and/or move it. And that's
    very slow.

    With the **Improved Screen Management** you :func:`place()` the sprite and then just
    :func:`delete()` it. And since it is only one object reference it is a very fast
    operation (we only place or delete one cell of the buffer).

    When :func:`update()` is called, it first look at the state of the buffers and call
    :func:`render()` if needed (i.e: if something has change in the display buffer). The
    buffers are only rendered when needed.

    When :func:`render()` is called it goes through the display buffer and render
    each elements transforming it into a printable sequence that is stored in the
    frame buffer. The rendering is done from the bottom right corner of the screen to
    the top left corner. This allows for cleaning junk characters at no additional cost.

    **TL;DR:** The **display buffer** hold the objects placed on the screen while the
    **frame buffer** hold the rendered representation of the display buffer.

    The Screen object also inherits from the :class:`~pygamelib.base.PglBaseObject` and
    if the object that is :func:`place()`-ed is an instance of
    :class:`~pygamelib.base.PglBaseObject`, the screen will automatically attach itself
    to the object. When notified of a change it will trigger a render cycle before the
    next update.

    In terms of performances, depending on your terminal emulator and CPU you will most
    certainly achieve over 30 FPS. Here are a couple of benchmark results:

     * On an Intel Core i7 @ 4.20 GHz: 50 to 70 FPS.
     * On an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X @ 4.80 GHz: 60 to 100 FPS.

    The new **Improved Screen Management** is faster than the legacy stack in most of
    the cases. The only case when the legacy Direct Display stack might be faster is
    in the case of a game or application with only simple ASCII characters and not a lot
    of things to display.

    Here are some compiled benchmark results of both of systems over 150 runs:

    You can use the 2 benchmark scripts to compare on your system:

     * benchmark-screen-buffer.py
     * benchmark-screen-direct-display.py

    The frame buffer system has been tested on the following terminals:

    * xterm-256color
    * Konsole
    * Kitty
    * Alacritty
    * GNOME Terminal

    Performances are consistants across the different terminals. The only exception is
    the GNOME Terminal, which is slower than the others (about 20~30 % slower).
